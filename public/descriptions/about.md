# SHIFT - Sustainable Horizons in Future Transport

Transforming transport is a key energy challenge in the Nordic region to achieve the ambitious climate targets set by the Nordic governments. By developing and applying tools that integrate fuel options, modal shifts, business models and consumer behaviour into scenario modelling and in-depth analysis covering urban passenger transport, long-haul freight and city logistics the Shift project informs smarter Nordic transport and energy policy. 

Besides strengthening Nordic energy systems modelling and providing updated scenario analysis for the Nordic transport sector, Shift examines linkages between technological and organisational innovations that can decarbonise the road transport system. In addition Shift assesses drivers, barriers and effects of transport modal shifts and analyses effective design of transport related policy instruments. Shift includes assessments on the Nordic level as well as policy relevant local Nordic case studies highlighting opportunities and challenges for the transition of the transport sector.

Shift is led by IVL Swedish Environmental Research Institute and state of the art researchers from DTU Technical University of Denmark, TOI Institute of Transport Economics, RISE Viktoria and Energiforsk. SHIFT is one of the Nordic Flagship Projects for 2016-2019, funded by Nordic Energy Research. 

In Shift there is a strong collaboration with three Nordic think tanks all oriented towards sustainability and working to influence policy, Swedish Fores, Norwegian Zero, and Danish Concito.
